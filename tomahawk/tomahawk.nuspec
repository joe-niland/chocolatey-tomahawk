    <summary>Tomahawk, the multi-source music player</summary>
    <description>Tomahawk is a music player that fundamentally changes the way music is consumed and shared. It decouples the name of the song from the source it was shared from - and fulfills the request using all of your available sources. This creates a universal translation layer across music repositories, streaming services and geographic territories.</description>
